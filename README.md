### Overview ###

This is the Arduino microcontroller code for an infrared motion sensor connected to an Android application.
When motion is detected, the microcontroller communicates to a running Android application via Bluetooth
to play a sound and show a notification. The notification is dismissed and the microcontroller
is ready to detect the next movement. The alarm can be disabled for 1 minute from the application
and if the connection is lost during use, a different sound will play.
